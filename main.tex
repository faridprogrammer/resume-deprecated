		{Technical Team Lead}

		{I have worked in the OMS software team as a backend developer. In that period I've managed to implement complex treasury logic for continuously in-use OMS software and replace it with the previous troublesome module. I have developed an in-house broker back-office module for the OMS software that lets the OMS work independently from existing back-office software in the market. I am currently in charge of another project in the company that focuses on portfolio management features. This software needs to be changed to make it available for much bigger customers, which is one of my goals in the new team. Making the team more efficient, reliable, and happy is another goal of mine in the new team. I believe I've had good progress in both goals because of my technical and interpersonal skills.}
